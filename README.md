## About

This project uses Vosk, AudioRecord, and AudioTrack to perform offline speech recognition and playback. Users will be able to record their voice, then get a text-to-speech copy of their words after stopping the recording. They will also be able to play back the recorded audio if they want. The audio is replaced each time the user records their voice. 


## Vosk Library

This project was forked from the official Vosk demo project. Documentation and instructions for using the Vosk Library can be found at [this website](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/android).
